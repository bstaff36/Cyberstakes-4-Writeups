# Cyberstakes 4 Writeups

Thanks to the organizers for a great competition!

I'm hoping to post more detailed writeups for the reversing/binary problems, but this is what I have for now.

If this repo doesn't have the problem you're looking for, or you have questions, let me know on the ACICTF slack (madStacks). Any new writeups I make I'll post here.
